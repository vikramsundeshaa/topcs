### smaller heading

To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

---------------------

Bold text = **    **   
I just love **bold text**.

Italic *   *    
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

Bold and Italic Best Practices   = ***    ***   
This is really ***very*** important text.

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.   
> Dorothy followed her

Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs   
Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs   
> Dorothy followed her   
>  
> and she looked back  

Nested Blockquotes   
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.  
> Dorothy followed her  
>   
>> and she looked back  

Lists  
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.   

Ordered Lists  
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.   

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item  

unordered list use   -   in the start

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item
- 1960, was the year  



Adding Elements in Lists  
To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.   
   
      


# ***Images***  
start with ! then without space [](here the path of image)  
![xyz photo](/path/file.png)  


**Lists**  
You can nest an unordered list in an ordered list, or vice versa.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
4. Fourth item  


# **Links**  
o create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).  
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).  
click here(https://google.com)  

**URLs and Email Addresses**  

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.  <   >  

<https://www.markdownguide.org>  
<fake@example.com>  

**Escaping Characters**  
To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (\) in front of the character.  
\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.
